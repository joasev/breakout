# Bevy Breakout Exploration

This repository is a quick exploration of the [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) engine. The project starts with a copy of the Bevy Breakout template and introduces modifications to enhance the gameplay and physics. Namely, varying bouncing angles and a mechanism for losing were added. The aim is to do a simple yet more engaging version of Breakout, providing insight into the Bevy engine's functionality.
